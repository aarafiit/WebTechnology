## Overview
This repository contains files for an Attendance System. The system is designed to help organizations and educational institutions track and manage the attendance of their members or students. Below is a brief description of each file in this repository:

attendance.sql - This is the SQL file containing the database schema and structure required for the system. You'll need to import this file into your database to set up the necessary tables.

fetchData.php - This PHP file is responsible for fetching attendance data from the database. It may be used to display attendance records or generate reports.

index.php - This is the main PHP file for the system. It likely serves as the front-end interface where users can interact with the attendance system.

markAttendance.html - This HTML file is used to capture attendance. It could be a form where users select their names and mark their attendance.

process_attendance.php - This PHP file is responsible for processing attendance marks submitted through markAttendance.html. It may validate input, update the database, and perform any necessary calculations.

styles.css - This is the primary CSS file responsible for styling the user interface of the attendance system.

styles2.css - This could be an additional CSS file for custom styling, or it may serve a specific purpose within the system.
